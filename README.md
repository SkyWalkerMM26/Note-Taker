* The user's saved notes will be store unless they have click the red trash icon associated to that list-item. 
* If the user decides to delete the task by clicking on the red trash icon, the list item will disappear once the user enters a new Note Title and Note Text.
* On any page, clicking the Note Taker Header on the top left of the page will take the user to the first landing page.
